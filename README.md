# Aquarius

Aquarius is a general-purpose LÃ–VE library containing various classes and functions that I've found myself sharing between projects.

Aquarius (and this readme) are a work-in-progress.

## Features

- `Scene` and `SceneManager` classes, which allow you to partition your project into independent scenes, who manage their own resources and come with their own event handlers. The scene manager handles initialising, disposing of, switching between and passing events to scenes.

- A `Tweener` class, which can smoothly transition any property of any table between two values. The smoothing function can be customised; several functions are provided, such as linear and sinusoidal.
